- Cloud Services

    - Computing
    - Storage
    - Big Data Analytics
    - Networking
    - Pricing



- Google Cloud Storage provides a managed CDN that provides edge caching to make resources
    quickly available in different geographic regions.



- Example Projects

    - ToDo List = simplest possible app that stores and retrieves data
    - InstaSnap = social media site that was built quickly and now needs to scale up fast
    - E*Exchange = stock-trading application with stringent regulatory requirements



- Projects

    - Isolated container for resources
    - For instance, if we create a new VM, it will be owned by the parent project
    - Gets its own billing, useful if you have multiple clients
    - Segment roles for security, access and credentials are granted per project
    - The creator of a project can access all projects they created



- Installing the SDK

    1. Download and extract the SDK

         $ curl -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/
                     google-cloud-sdk-319.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

         $ tar -xvf https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/
                     google-cloud-sdk-319.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

         * Note: Don't use aptitude to install the sdk, since it won't include the
             gcloud package manager.


    2. Install the SDK and update any components.

         $ ./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
         $ gcloud components update


    3. Initialize the SDK.  This includes authorizing the SDK to use your user account
         credentials.

         $ gcloud init



- Other gcloud Commands

    1. To log in from the command prompt (a web tab will be opened):

         $ gcloud auth login

       To also save credentials for later logins:

         $ gcloud auth application-default login


    2. To switch projects:

         $ gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID



- Adding a New VM

    - In our first project, click
        > Compute Engine > VM Instances > Create

    - VM names must be unique within a project.

    - Once the VM is created, click the 'SSH' button to get a shell.



- Using the SDK Command Line

    - List the VM instances in our project:

        $ gcloud compute instances list


    - Connect to our VM:

        $ gcloud compute ssh learning-cloud-demo


    - Under the hood, Google is:

        1. Using the credentials it obtained when you ran 'gcloud auth login'
        2. Generating a new public/private key pair
        3. Securely putting the new public key onto the virtual machine
        4. Using the private key generated to connect to the machine



- Writing Code to Interact with VMs

    - First, install the Google Cloud client library for node.js.

        $ npm install --save @google-cloud/compute@0.7.1


    - Now, we can run our scripts.

        $ node show_vms.js
        $ node show_and_stop_vms.js
