| CHAPTER 2 - DEPLOYING WORDPRESS                                             |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- For our WordPress installation, we will need:

    1. A VM with WordPress and Apache installed
    2. A SQL database



- To start a cloud SQL instance:

    > Cloud Console > Storage > SQL > Create Instance

    name: wordpress-db
    pw: longpassword!
    version: MySQL 5.7


    - By default, Cloud SQL starts with a 10GB SSD, and the size of the disk
        automatically increases as needed.


    - Now we can see our new SQL instance from the SDK console:

        $ gcloud sql instances list



- Securing the Cloud SQL Instance

    - Change the password for the root user

        $ gcloud sql users set-password root --host "%" --password "longpassword2!" 
                --instance wordpress-db


    - Now, for testing, we'll temporarily open the SQL instance to the outside world.  We'll
        add '0.0.0.0/0', which means all possible IP addresses.  Obviously, we should never have
        a production database set up like this.

        > Cloud SQL Instance > Connections > Authorized Networks > Add Network
        > CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0



- Connecting to the Cloud SQL Instance

    - First, we need to install the MySQL client locally.

        $ sudo apt-get install -y mysql-client


    - Now, we can connect to our cloud instance:

        # Get ip address
        $ gcloud sql instances list

        # Connect to cloud instance
        $ mysql -h 104.197.207.227 -u root -p


    - Connected to our cloud instance, let's create the database.

        mysql> CREATE DATABASE wordpress;

        mysql> CREATE USER wordpress IDENTIFIED BY 'very-long-wordpress-password';

        mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO wordpress;
