- Reasons you may need to consider the specific location of the data centers:

    1. Ultra-low-latency requirements, like with high-frequency trading
    2. Customer base far from data centers, like in Africa or Australia



- Isolation Levels and Fault Tolerance

    - Zones

        - A zone is the smallest unit in which a resource can exist.  A zone can be 
            thought of as a single building or cluster of buildings.

        - A natural disaster or power outage could take out the entire zone.

        - Latency within a zone is very low.


    - Regions

        - A region is a collection of zones, and corresponds loosely to a city.

        - Resources that are in the same region, but different zones (for example 'us-east1-b'
            and 'us-east1-c'), should still have pretty low latency.

        - Resources in different zones are isolated from zone-specific failures, but not
            region-level failures like natural disasters.


    - Designing for Fault Tolerance

        - Zonal
            - If the zone goes down, the service goes down

        - Regional
            - Service is replicated throughout multiple zones in a single region

            - For instance, a MongoDB instance is located in 'us-east1-b' and a hot
                failover is located in 'us-east1-c'

            - Much safer than zonal, but still not enough redundancy for mission-critcal systems

        - Multiregional
            - Composed of several different regional services

        - Global
            - Multiregional service that is spread around the world

            - Crosses legal jurisdictions and network providers

            - Will often want to use multiple cloud providers for even more redundancy


    - Automatic High Availability

        - Google Cloud Storage provides multiregional fault isolation for storage needs.

        - Google Cloud Datastorage provides non-relational storage the same way.

        - Using these services requires some additional thinking about your architecture.



- Safety Concerns - Security

    - Any data stored in the cloud is most likely located on more than one disk drive.


    - 3 Typical Security Goals

        1. Privacy = only authorized people have access
        2. Availability = resources should always be accessible to authorized people
        3. Durability = the resources should never be corrupted or go missing


    - Cloud Providers Strategy for Dealing with Risks

        1. Secure Facilities
        2. Encryption (anything stored on disk)
        3. Replication
        4. Backups (off-site)


- Safety Concerns - Privacy

    - Google Cloud Storage will keep your photo in an encrypted form, but when it arrives
        back to you, it is unencrypted.  This is because Google has the encryption keys.

    - If Google receives a court order, they will decrypt your data and hand it over.


- Safety Concerns - Special Cases

    - Some special situations require heightened levels of security or privacy.  For example:

        - Governement agencies often have strict requirements
        - Companies in US health care must comply with HIPAA regulations
        - Companies dealing with personal data of German citizens must comply with BDSG


    - Solutions to these problems include:

        - Amazon offers GovCloud for government agencies
        - Google, Azure, and AWS will all sign BAAs to support HIPAA-covered customers
        - Azure and Amazon offer data centers in Germany to comply with BDSG
