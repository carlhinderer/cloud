-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Using VPNs

    - If you send a request via HTTP, the ISP can see the entire contents of the 
        request.  If you use HTTPS, the contents of your request will be hidden, but
        the domain name will still be visible.

    - Governments also have backdoors into routers, so they can see the requests.

    - With a VPN,

        1. The computer sends a packet of encrypted data to the VPN server domain.

        2. The VPN server decrypts the data, finds out where the user wants to send
             the packet, then forwards the packet to the destination.

    - The VPN will know the user's browsing history, but the ISP does not.  Other
        routers after the VPN will see only the VPN IP address, not the user's IP
        address.



- Using Tor

    - Tor is an open source program for anonymizing internet traffic.  When using Tor,
        the computer sends an encrypted packet through a large number of volunteer
        relays.  

    - Each relay only knows where it came from and where it's going, and no relay knows 
        both the source and destination IP addresses.



- Geolocation

    - GPS

        - Started by US Government in 1973, now controls 30 satellites

        - GPS receivers are tiny sensors with antennas that receive radio signals
            from the satellites.

        - If a sensor can receive signals from at least 4 satellites, the receiver
            can calculate its position using trilateration.

        - Works best in an outdoor environment with a clear view of the sky.

        - Smartphones can typically record a geolocation to within 5m in open sky.

        - Is affected by roofs, walls, or other physical barriers, but is still the 
            most precise source of geolocation data.


    - WiFi Positioning System

        - Works well in dense, urban areas where GPS does not work as well

        - A device with a WiFi antenna can scan for WiFi access points and measure the
            signal strength to each network.

        - The device determines the location of each access point by looking it up in a
            WiFi location database.

        - Then the device estimates its own location using the locations and signal 
            strengths of the networks.


    - Cell Tower Triangulation

        - In the US, cellular phones are required to report approximate locations for
            911 emergency calls.  If a cell phone is unable to use GPS, it can use
            cell tower triangulation.

        - A cell tower is 3 sets of directional antenna arrays in a triangular shape.

        - The cell tower can estimate the distance between the tower and a phone by
            measuring the round-trip delivery time and signal strength.

        - A rough location can be obtained by doing this with each array from a single
            tower, but multiple towers will help narrow the location to a smaller area.


    - IP-Based Geolocation

        - IP geolocation databases contain millions of rows mapping IP addresses to 
            locations.  They are created from sources such as regional IP registries,
            user-submitted locations on websites, data from ISPs, and estimates based
            on network routes.

        - This is the last resort for geolocation, since it is the least accurate.

        - Using a VPN will make this method impossible.



- Security Risks

    - Phishing and Spear-Phishing


    - Rogue Wireless Access Points
        - Passive Interception
        - Active Interception
        - Use VPNs or HTTPS


    - Malware Types

        - Trojan Horse = masquerades as a legitimate program

        - Virus = self-replicating, copies itself into other files

        - Worm = self-replicating, copies itself onto different computers across the network

        - Example - ILOVEYOU worm that infected Windows machines in 2000
            1. User opens email attachment, which is actually an executable program
            2. Program overwrites certain files with a copy of itself
            3. Program sends email to all contacts in Outlook address book


    - Effects of Malware

        - Spyware = steals data and sends it back to the malware creators (ie keyloggers)

        - Adware = pops up advertisements to users

        - Ransomware = encrypts user data and demands ransom for decryption key
                         (ie WannaCry in 2017)

        - Cryptomining = utilizes a computer's resources to mine for cryptocurrency


    - Protection

        - Security Patches = update to application or OS that fixes exploited bug

        - Firewalls = monitor incoming and outgoing traffic and block suspicious traffic

        - Antivirus software = scan files and folders looking for malware
