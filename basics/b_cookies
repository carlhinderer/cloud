- Web Cookies

    - An HTTP cookie is a small amount of text that helps a website track information
        about a user across multiple pages of the website and personalize their user
        experience.

        1. A browser requests a website.

             GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
             Host: www.shoopshop.com


        2. A server sends a cookie with the response.

             HTTP/1.0 200 OK
             Content-type: text/html
             Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT

           If it wanted to, it could also add more 'Set-Cookie' headers to the response.


        3. The browser stores the cookie.  This way, it will persist even after restarting
             the browser.  This is why it's called a 'persistent cookie'.

           There are also 'session cookies', which have no expiration date and are deleted
             when the browser is closed.


        4. The browser then sends the cookie with each subsequent HTTP request.  

             GET /shop.html HTTP/1.1
             Cookie: sessionId=abc123


        5. The server personalized responses based on the value of the cookie.



- Example Uses of Cookies

    - Remember how many results a user prefers seeing per page.
    - Recommend related headlines or related products.
    - Track analytics, like how long a user has spent on a page or what buttons they clicked.
    - Keep a user logged in.



- Third Party Cookies

    - Each cookie stored by a browser is associated with a domain and path.  When
        you visit a website and its server sends back an HTTP response with a 
        cookie, the browser associates that cookie with the domain of the server.
        This is called a 'first-party cookie'.

    - A website can also include resources from other domains, like an image, iframe,
        or script.  When the browser requests those resources, they can send back their
        own cookies, which will be associated with their domains.  These are called
        'third party cookies'.

    - In a 2016 study, the average website loaded 20 cookies.  The average news site
        loaded twice that many!  Most are used for advertising.

    - A website can track a user's browsing history across other websites by using
        third-party cookies, as long as each site loads the cookie from the same domain.
